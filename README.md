# Self-Balancing-Inverted-Pendelum
Modeling and simulation of an inverted pendulum that is self balanced with two reaction wheels. The control algorith is still not perfect but I will be working on it soon. 

#### CAD model of the system: 

The system was created in FreeCAD and all the files can be found in the link below:

https://grabcad.com/library/self-balancing-stick-1

And an image preview of it:

Note the the model has the test bech attached to it, this is only for testing puposes to try out only one axis at the time.

#### Demo of dynamics:

The parameters of the system were assumed and are not from the model, this animation demostrates the speeding up of the wheel from the ground position and followed by a sudden deacceleration that results in a torque applyed on the pivot point that ultimatly lifts the pendulum up.
