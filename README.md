# Self-Balancing-Inverted-Pendelum
Modeling and simulation of an inverted pendulum that is self balanced with two reaction wheels. The control algorith is still not perfect but I will be working on it soon. 

#### CAD model of the system: 

The system was created in FreeCAD and all the files can be found in the link below:

And an image preview of it:

Note the the model has the test bech attached to it, this is only for testing puposes to try out only one axis at the time.

#### Demo of dynamics:
